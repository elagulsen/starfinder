<h1>Skyglow Star Finder</h1>
  <h2>By Ela Gulsen, for the CMU Skyglow class.</h2>
  <p>To get started, input your zip code if you live in the US! </p> <br>

  <input id="zipcode" class="qty" type="number" placeholder="zip code" />
  <input id="zipButton" type="button" value="submit"> <br>

  <!-- <p> If you don't live in the US, or know your coordinates, type them in here: </p>
  <p> Latitude: </p>
  <p> Longitude: </p> -->

  <br><br>
  <div id="result"> <b> results </b> </div>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>The Star Finder takes into account your latitude and longitude, and matches it to Sky Quality Meter measurements taken around your area.<br>
    These measurements are used to determine how bright, or light polluted, the night sky is in your area.<br>
    Based on this information, as well as the position of the stars on the day you access this website, the Star Finder will generate a list of
    stars it thinks you might be able to see outside on a clear night!</p>

    <h3>This doesn't seem right. I can see more/less stars where I am!</h3>
    <p>The number of stars you can see is an estimation, and can vary depending on factors like sky brightness, weather, and more.
      <br>Star Finder does its best to estimate how many stars you would be able to see on a clear, cloudless night, on avarage in your area.</p>

    <h3>Why doesn't it work for my zip code?</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately, not every zip code has Sky Quality Meter data available!</p>
