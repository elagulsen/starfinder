    <h1>FAQs</h1>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>The Star Finder takes into account your latitude and longitude, and matches it to Sky Quality Meter measurements taken around your area.<br>
    These measurements are used to determine how bright, or light polluted, the night sky is in your area.<br>
    Based on this information, as well as the position of the stars on the day you access this website, the Star Finder will generate a list of
    stars it thinks you might be able to see outside on a clear night!</p>

    <h3>This doesn't seem right. I can see more/less stars where I am!</h3>
    <p>The number of stars you can see is an estimation, and can vary depending on factors like sky brightness, weather, and more.
      <br>Star Finder does its best to estimate how many stars you would be able to see on a clear, cloudless night, on average in your area.</p>

    <h3>Why doesn't it work for my location?</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately, not every location has Sky Quality Meter data available! In particular, there is a lot of data for the US and Europe, but not a lot in other areas of the world.
      <br>If you want to engage in citizen science and contribute to light pollution research by taking measurements using just your phone, check out the <a href="https://www.darkskymeter.com/index.php">Dark Sky Meter website</a>!</p>

    <h3>Where did you get the data from?</h3>
    <p>The sky quality meter data is from Dark Sky Meter, which you can access <a href="https://www.darkskymeter.com/index.php">here</a>. Dark Sky Meter was developed by Norbert Schmidt and Harro Treur.
    <br>The star data was taken from the HYG database, which you can access <a href="http://www.astronexus.com/hyg">here</a>.</p>
